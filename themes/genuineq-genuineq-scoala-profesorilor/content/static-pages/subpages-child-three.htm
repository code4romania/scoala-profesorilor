<p>This is a sample child page for the Parent page item SubPages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sidebar menu is automatically generated when creating a menu item with the same name as the parent page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since this page is called 'SubPages' we create a Menu item named <strong>"SubPages"</strong> as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then set the menu item type to a <strong>StaticPage</strong>, and ensure <strong>"Allow nested items"</strong> and <strong>"Replace this item with its generated children"</strong> are selected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sidebar Menu should then be automatically generated when visiting any of the child pages.</p>
