<p><strong>Important information</strong></p>
<p>You have to specifically add the component `siteSearchInclude` to every CMS page you want to be searched.</p>
<p>Pages <strong>without</strong> this component will <strong>not</strong> be searched.</p>

<p>Components on CMS pages will <strong>not</strong> be rendered. Use this provider only for simple html pages. All Twig syntax will be stripped out to prevent the leaking of source code to the search results.</p>

<p>CMS pages with dynamic URLs (like <code>/page/:slug</code>) won't be linked correctly from the search results listing
    .</p>

<p>If you have CMS pages with dynamic contents consider writing your own search provider (see
<code>Add support for custom plugin contents</code>) in <a target="_blank"
